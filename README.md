# SA (ATTENTION)
Mobile app synchronizes your music to your heartbeat, creating a perfect tempo during exercising. 
Weâ€™ll use the Apple Watch API to get a live feed of your heart rate and use our algorithm to pick 
a new track from the Spotify library when your heartbeat rate changes significantly.

For SA server testing under windows change code inside project.json to code from wproject.json
